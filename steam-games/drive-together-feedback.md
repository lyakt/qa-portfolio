# Drive Together Demo — QA Feedback

## Positive
- Beautiful atmosphere.
- Well-designed and visually appealing map.

## Issues / Improvements

### Character customization UX issue
- There is no separate window to customize the character.
- The character is seated inside the car, making customization inconvenient.
- Only color can be changed, but the selected color is not clearly visible.

Suggestion:  
Add a separate character customization screen or improve camera visibility.

---

### Mouse wheel control inconsistency
- Rotating the character using the mouse wheel feels inconvenient.
- In the main menu, mouse movement rotates the character, which feels more intuitive.

Suggestion:  
Use the same mouse rotation behavior as in the main menu.
